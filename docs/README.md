# Getting started

The website is made with [MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/).

To get started, create a Python virtual environment, activate it and install Material for MkDocs:

```bash
python -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate

pip install mkdocs-material
```

Then, you can start the development server with:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

Improvements are encouraged! Just click the little pencil mark on a page you'd like to change and submit a pull request.

If you'd like to do more advanced changes (e.g. adding a page, changing the styling), the [Material for MkDocs documentation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/) is very helpful.
